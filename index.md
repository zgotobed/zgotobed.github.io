## About

I am a Physics PhD candidate at Colorado State University with a strong focus on
**numerical simulation, optical engineering, and the development of state of the art lasers**.

My work spans precision measurement, optical systems, and trapped ion quantum computing,
with hands-on experience building hardware, writing numerical simulations in Python and C++,
and applying these techniques to real-world problems. I am particularly interested in roles **working in quantum computing**, So that I can
apply my skills and experiences to help build the next generation of quantum machines.

## Selected Projects

### Optical Clock Simulation Framework
Developed a Python and C++ simulation suite for evaluating novel optical clocking
methods. This framework reduced experimental iteration time by enabling rapid,
high-fidelity numerical testing before hardware implementation.

**Technologies:** Python, C++, Monte Carlo methods, Git    
**Repository** [Github Repo](https://github.com/zgotobed/SannerLab)

### PyOpticL — Code-to-CAD Optical Design
Contributed to an open-source library that converts Python code into fully
parametrized optical layouts suitable for CAD and 3D printing.

Used in real experimental systems with demonstrated extremely high (99.9%) gate fidelity.

**Technologies:** Python, FreeCAD, OpenSCAD, optical simulation  
**Preprint:** [arXiv:2501.14957](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14957)

### Trapped-Ion Experiment Control Framework
Refactored and extended a large ARTIQ-based codebase into a modular, class-driven
framework for running complex experimental sequences.

Improved usability, reproducibility, and long-term maintainability of the system.

**Technologies:** ARTIQ
